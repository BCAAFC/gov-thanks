## Volunteers

Gave their time and energy supporting the youth and the GOV Team over the four days. This included a long list of people coming from agencies who sponsored the event. When an agency is willing to not only provide financial support, but allows their staff time to give hands on support, we truly see what our joint efforts can accomplish.

## Indigenous Youth

Many young Indigenous people were chosen to complete special work at GOV 2017, including:

Event MCs, Grace Dove and Linsay Willier, DJ O Show, aka Orene Askew, who assisted in transitions at Opening Ceremonies, the Youth Talent Showcase, Closing Ceremonies, and who DJâ€™d the Youth Dance Party, Sheri Marie who performed live original music at the Youth Dance Party, Streetrich, a hip hop dance troupe who performed at the Youth Dance Party, Jeremy Coyote, a magician who entertained at the Youth in Care Honouring Feast, and Trent Seymour for his riveting Keynote Address at Closing Ceremonies.
